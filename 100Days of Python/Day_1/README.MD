# What we Learn in Day 1?
In Day 1 topic is Introduction to Programming & Python

## What is Programming?
Programming is a way to tell the computer what it have to do. Computer does not understand any language like Bengali, English, Hindi, Spanish etc. It only understand 0 & 1 where 0 is fasle and 1 is true. This both number 0 & 1 is used for Binary Number. The programming Language helps people to tell the computer in Bengali, English, Hindi, Spanish etc language and the Language translate or convert this into Binary Language which computer understand. Then the computer do the work and show the output to us in our own language in same way using a programming Language.

## What is Python?
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a dynamically typed general purpose  Programming Language that supports object-oriented programming styles as well as a funcional programming styles.

- Python is interpreted & high level programming language.
- It was created by [Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in 1989.

## Features of Python
- Python is simple & easy to understandable.
- It is interpreted & platform0independent which helps debugging in a easy way.
- It's a open-source programming language.
- It has a big library support. (e.g.: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), etc.)
- It also help to connect with other programming language easily.

## What is Python used for
- It helps make charts and graphs for **data visualization**.
- It’s used in **data analysis** to find insights and trends from raw data.
- In **AI and Machine Learning**, Python helps computers learn from past data and act smart — without needing every rule coded in.
- It’s used to build **web applications**.
- Python can **work with databases** to store and manage data.
- In **business and accounting**, it helps with complex math and data analysis.
